# Analyzing Factors Affecting Housing Prices in Boston using R
**Introduction**:

In this project, we dissect the factors influencing housing prices in Boston to create predictive models for future pricing. Our data-driven approach sheds light on these variables, benefiting real estate stakeholders and decision-makers in Boston and beyond.

**Background**:

Our dataset, sourced from the MASS package in R, contains data on 506 Boston suburban neighborhoods, with fourteen key variables including crime rates, room counts, proximity to amenities, and more. Compiled in 1978, this dataset is vital in real estate, economics, and data science.

**Key Questions**:

**Crime Rates vs. Housing Prices**: Explore the correlation between crime rates and housing prices in Boston.
**Housing Characteristics**: Profile houses from affordable to expensive, offering insights into housing affordability.
**Multicollinearity in Regression**: Investigate multicollinearity's impact on housing price predictions.
This project equips real estate professionals with valuable insights for navigating Boston's housing market and informs property transactions.
